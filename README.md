Examples
========

    cat sample.csv | graph | dot -Tpng | feh -

In this example we pipe an election csv file to the graph binary and visualize the majority graph as a png

    egen -cand 5 -vote 20 -pref

In this example we generate a json election with 5 candidates (seats) and 20 votes forcing a preference.
Note that each 'vote' is actually a weighted vote with default weights ranging from 1-5. See help on
egen for more useful flags

    egen | report | dot -Tpng | feh -

In this example we generate a new election with all the default flags and create a dot file majority graph

    cat sample.csv | tally -i csv -o csv | column -s, -t

In this example we tally an election from a csv file and output it in csv format. Then pretty display it.

    egen | tally | jq .

In this example we generate a random election and tally it into a json result. The result is then pretty printed
